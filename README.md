## :tulip: Mirrored: Generative Images Using Diffusion
### Non-Artist Statement
My process for these 9 images involved a multitude of text-to-image outputs that were then converted into image-to-image outputs and generated multiple times. The settings were relatively consistent with an average of 30 steps and a 9 on the CFG scale. 
I opted to keep the noise below the CFG scale when using image-to-image for the best results. The goal of these images were to capture raw, private emotions from the perspective of an ordinary object, such as a mirror. 

<strong>The subjects are as follows:</strong>
- Mad Woman
- This is Me Trying
- Mirrorball
